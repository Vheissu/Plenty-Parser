# Plenty Parser for Codeigniter

## Intro
Plenty Parser is a driver based parser library for Codeigniter 2.0 and up. It allows you to render view templates using different drivers. Out of the box Plenty Parser will come with Smarty, Dwoo and Twig drivers for rendering your views. It has autdetection support which allows you to render views using different drivers based on file extension. Support for the in-built parser is still there as well.

It's still early days, but hopefully the library is of use in the next few days.

## Drivers
Plenty Parser uses drivers, if Plenty Parser doesn't come with a driver to support rendering templates with your preferred template engine, write one and share it with us. Twig, Smarty and Dwoo should satisfy 95% of all your needs.
